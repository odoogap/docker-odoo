# Introduction

Multistage and source code install with a smaller image size, based on the official Docker image for Odoo.

Only one volume for filestore, Enterprise and custom will be part of the image.

The full readme is generated over Odoo Docker Docs, specifically in [docker-library/docs/odoo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/odoo).
